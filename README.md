### From Beats to Data: A Spotify Analysis Project Using Advanced SQL

### 🎧 Project Title:

“Streaming Insights: Advanced SQL Analysis of Spotify Tracks and Trends”

### 📌 Business Problem:
Streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube generate vast amounts of data through user interaction, music performance, and artist engagement. However, businesses often struggle to leverage this raw data to identify high-performing content, artist trends, and listener engagement metrics.

### 🎯 Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of Spotify’s music streaming dataset using Advanced SQL techniques to extract insights related to:

* Track popularity

* Album performance

* Artist engagement

* Content licensing and video views

* Audio feature patterns (danceability, energy, liveness)

### 📂 Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains the following key tables/columns:

track_name, artist_name, album_name, album_type, stream_count

views, likes, official_video, comments

danceability, energy, liveness

spotify_streams, youtube_streams

licensed, track_id, album_id, artist_id

### 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Used:
* CTE (Common Table Expressions)
* Window Functions (e.g., DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, AVG OVER, PARTITION BY)
* Aggregate Functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)
* Boolean filters (licensed = TRUE, official_video = TRUE)
* Subqueries

### 📈 Business Impact:
* Identified top-performing artists and tracks based on views and streams.

* Highlighted which albums and singles drive user engagement.

* Surface insights for marketing teams about official videos and user interactions.

* Helped in A&R strategy by analyzing audio features (e.g., energy, danceability).

* Differentiated performance across Spotify vs YouTube, useful for platform-specific strategies.

### 🧪 Advanced SQL Techniques Explained:
* Window Functions like DENSE_RANK() were used to find top-performing tracks within each artist.

* CTEs were used to modularize logic for calculating differences (e.g., energy gap in albums).

* Used aggregate filtering and conditional logic (e.g., licensed = TRUE, official_video = TRUE) to drive targeted analysis.

* Subqueries for comparing metrics against global averages (e.g., liveness scores).

* Clean and efficient GROUP BY queries for aggregation and segmentation.

### 💼 Business Solutions from the Spotify SQL Analysis Project
1. Track and Artist Performance Optimization
* Identifying tracks with >1B streams or highest energy helps the platform promote trending songs, suggest them in playlists, and focus marketing on top-performing content.

* Business teams can negotiate better deals or visibility for high-performing artists.

2. Content Strategy for Album Types
* Analyzing albums of type "single" and their engagement gives insight into user preference — whether users engage more with singles or full albums — guiding release strategies.

3. Cross-Platform Insights (Spotify vs YouTube)
* Tracks streamed more on Spotify than YouTube can help in platform-specific promotion.

* Allows the business to optimize where to release or advertise content based on consumption patterns.

4. Audience Engagement Through Official Videos
* By evaluating views and likes on official videos, the team understands which content format performs best — driving video content planning and YouTube strategies.

5. Licensing Strategy Insights
* Total comments for licensed content reveal whether licensing improves user interaction, supporting legal and licensing investment decisions.

6. Audio Feature Trends (Danceability, Energy, Liveness)
* Tracks with above-average liveness or high energy can inform A&R teams and producers on what traits make songs more engaging or streamable.

7. Artist-Level Planning and Ranking
* Using window functions to rank top 3 tracks per artist helps record labels identify which songs to push further or include in curated lists.

8. Performance Gaps Between Albums
* The CTE-based calculation of energy variability within albums helps evaluate album cohesion and listener experience quality, informing future production choices.

### Conclusion:
In this project, I worked on a Spotify dataset to extract music streaming insights using advanced SQL. The focus was on identifying high-performing tracks, artist engagement, and analyzing audio metrics like energy and danceability. I used CTEs to calculate per-album feature gaps, window functions to rank tracks per artist, and aggregation to uncover trends in user interaction. The project highlighted how SQL can go beyond simple querying to deliver deep analytical value for the business.
